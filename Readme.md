RAG with Gemini + Qdrant

This project is a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application.
It lets you upload a PDF, stores its content in a vector database (Qdrant), and allows you to ask questions about the document. The answers are generated by Google Gemini LLM with citations from the uploaded file.

Features
1.Upload a PDF file and process its text into embeddings.
2.Store and manage embeddings in Qdrant (vector database).
3.Retrieve the most relevant chunks for a given query.
4.Generate answers with context using Gemini (Generative AI).
5.Display answers along with source text snippets for transparency.

How it Works
1.Upload a PDF -The text is extracted and chunked.
2.Embedding - Text chunks are converted into vectors using SentenceTransformer.
3.Store in Qdrant - Embeddings are stored in a Qdrant collection.
4.Query - User enters a question.
5.Retrieve and Generate - Relevant chunks are retrieved and passed to Gemini to generate an answer with citations.

Installation
Clone this repository:
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-gemini-qdrant.git
  cd rag-gemini-qdrant

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following keys:
  api_key=your_gemini_api_key
  QDRANT_URL=your_qdrant_url
  QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key

Add .env.example in your repo with the same keys but without values.

Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
  streamlit run your_script_name.py
1.Upload a PDF file through the interface.
2.Ask questions in the text box.
3.The app will show the answer and the sources used.

Remarks
1.The app currently supports only PDF uploads.
2.Embedding model used: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (dimension = 384).
3.Retrieval is top-k (default = 3).
4.No re-ranking is implemented yet. Adding a reranker could improve result quality.
5.Performance depends on PDF content and embedding quality.

Next Steps (if extended)
1.Add a re-ranker for better retrieval quality.
2.Support multiple file uploads.
3.Improve citation formatting.
4.Deploy on a free hosting service (Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces, Render, etc.).
